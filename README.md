# Accident-Prevention-and-control-system
The objective of the system is to avoid accident by giving indication through buzzer. Accidents are very common therefore it is necessary to develop a system to avoid accidents. Now-a-days accidents are happening more frequent due to globalization, lack of attention, drowsiness, fast speed.  To overcome this problem the system has been developed in a simple manner using arduino, ultrasonic sensors,accelerometer sensor. This proposed system gives indication of vehicles coming from opposite side by using buzzer. Also if accident occurs as soon as the car position is titled its detected by accelerometer sensor and a message will be sent to nearby hospital and to the emergency contact of driver using GSM module used.
