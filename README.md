# Accident-Prevention-and-control-system
- The objective of the system is to avoid accident by giving indication through buzzer. 
- Accidents are very common therefore it is necessary to develop a system to avoid accidents. 
- Now-a-days accidents are happening more frequent due to globalization, lack of attention, drowsiness, fast speed.  
- To overcome this problem the system has been developed in a simple manner using arduino, ultrasonic sensors,accelerometer sensor. 
- This proposed system gives indication of vehicles coming from opposite side by using buzzer. 
- Also if accident occurs as soon as the car position is titled its detected by accelerometer sensor and a message will be sent to nearby hospital and to the emergency contact of driver using GSM module used.
